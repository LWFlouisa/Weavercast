Welcome to the Uploaded Fairy podcast, where I will be discussing the ins and out of my podcast. I will still be building a brand image over on Youtube. But the majority of the content will be on this website rather than on youtube, which I consider to be inherently illegitimate, just like Comicsgate and Mainstream Comics.

For my official webcomic, you can find it here: <a href="https://lwflouisa.github.io/UploadedFairyP1/">Uploaded Fairy P1</a>
