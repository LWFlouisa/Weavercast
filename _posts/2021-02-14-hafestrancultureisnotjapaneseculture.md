In a way, Hafestran closer is closer to an Indigenous French culture than Japanese. There is still somewhat of an influence from Japan that has lasted longer than even some aspects of French culture, such as in most of the supernatural and folklore narratives. Hafestran culture also has a different relationship with the guillotine, having been colonized by France. Much in the same way anyone colonized by France would. Their fashion is closer to 19th century French fashion than Japanese, most noteably in the foot ware. They wear Sabots rather than Geta.

However asking someone to write about Japan and France is somewhat like asking a Korean to write about Japan, or an Italian to write about France. Or a Native American to write about what they think about white settlers.
