title: Esioma -- What Is A Purse Drama
published: true
---
A Purse Drama is an 8 inch width and 5 inch height manga issue roughly sixteen pages, designed to fit efficiently in your purse. Unlike Epitati and Erucher format, these are intended to be thrown away and printed on cheap newsprint paper. Eventually these may move into the short story collection format.

These will be small sections of larger "Comics Poetry" I will be rolling out.
