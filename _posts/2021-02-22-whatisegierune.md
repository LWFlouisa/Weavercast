While Fasehasi delves a little bit into LGBT history Hafestran American society, in this genre, LGBT stories are almost entirely the focus. By LGBT, think something closer to Yaoi and Yuri, and not the Post-Modernist conceptions that are not based on science. These specifically revolve around the impact of the Franco-Japanese war on gay couples, and sometimes ( though more rare ) also around the impact of Transmen and Transwomen in the war period.

Frequently, one or both of the partners is not accepted in the society in which they were raised ( in this sense, egierune is more dystopian than your standard Yaoi and Yuri ), and therefore will go to great things to hide their relationship with their significant other. There is also often considerable differences between the way the French accept LGBT people, and the way Japanese society treats LGBT people.

Because of the Post-War context, these are generally set in apocalyptic landscapes based around old rundown factories, and other government buildings and locations in disrepair. Think of this as the Alternative Comix variation of Yaoi and Yuri, after the publishing industry has been rebuilt after the war.
