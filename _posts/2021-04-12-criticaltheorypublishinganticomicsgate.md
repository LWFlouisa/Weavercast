title: A Critique Of Breadtube, Publishing, and Comicsgate
published: true

We have total nonsense going on in both political and literary discussion. You have Comicsgate that claims to support independant creators, but actually does not. You have Breadtube that claims to support minorities, when in fact they consider Asians and Trans Women to be Caucasian and Cis gendered "adjacent" despite have completely obscene it is to treat actual BIPOC and LGBT people this way if they can't get behind critical theory. You have sharp left and right-wing camps in comics, despite me thinking Graphic Novels might be a more hospitable environment for me to market myself.

US as trans women and trans men should not be expected to write about Multiculturalism, Diversity, and Critical Theory just to be seen as left-wing enough. It completely transphobic to even expect to have to have a specific political idealogy one way or the other. So someone like myself, who is a normal trans girl ( not these cis gendered assholes that don't understand trans issues at all, yet dominating the discussion ) has no chance in the mainstream publishing environment either in novels or comics.

This is why increasingly, despite them condemning Comicsgate, they quietly do weirdly similar Comicsgate-like things by preventing actual Trans Women and Trans Men from getting hooked with a literary agent because we refuse to be little "let me pat you on the head" internet radicals. When you have your idealogy so entrenched into the establishment / mainstream like Comicsgate and Critical Theory: it is not radical by definition.

Radicalism is the unpopular viewpoint, and apparently wanting to be seen as a normal Transwoman is the unpopular viewpoint these days. Not Comicsgate, not Breadtube. But simply a normal Graphic Artist, Song Writer, and Novelist who just happens to be trans, because when transness literally meant needing to medically transition.

Preventing normal trans woemn from being published, is the most transphobic thing publishing can do.

You want to actually not be transphobic? Not blacklisting creators like myself because that don't want to kiss Critical Theory ass, and want to be seen as normal people who happen to be trans women, out of the Trade Publishing industry, is a really good start.

You can also not allow for blatant double standards like what happened at Absolute Write: https://lwflouisa.github.io/Weavercast/doublestandardsinmoderationatabsolutewrite
