This episode goes into how Comicsgate basically argue for "realistic art" essentially in bad faith, and how tracing photographs does not constitue being "fine art" skills. If anything, this i the furthest thing from being fine art. And yet they advertise this as being "superior" to the art style found in Graphic Novel written by "SJWs".

To make matters worse, Mainstream comics encourages people to ignore the bullshit of Comicsgate, rather than actually address their bad arguments one by one. What this does is essentially normalize their behaviour, rather than condemning it.

This is why the Comics Industry is dying, it has nothing to do with "bad art skills by SJWs".
