title: Esiomo: What Is Chef Esiomo?
published: true
---
Chef Esiomo is comparable to episodes on a cooking channel, but specifically revolving around Lusophone, French, and Japanese cuisine. These stories revolve around the life of Portuguese, French, and Japanese chefs as they learn each otherâ€™s crafts, and explore how they grow up wanting to become world famous chefs, to finally becoming one.

This sub-genre is similar to Cooking Manga, where the entire story focuses on the lives of chefs rather than traditional protagonists. Conflict generally arises from either not producing a meal fast enough, accidentally inducing food poisoning, or some other dangers to the chef or the person who orders the food. The stories can end on a lighter note, with the chef finally perfecting their craft, and not poisoning their customers.

Ones that cross over with Gothique Dii Esiomo, can also end on a darker note, where the chef, who managed to poison everyone in a restaurant, is sentenced to death by guillotine as well. Although do to the nature of the setting, the National Razor crossbow is a different beheading machine from the traditional guillotine, much like how The Falling Ax in Germany eventually diverged from the Berger Guillotine model.

You can have a chopping good time, reading stories about chefs who succeed or fail at not poisoning their customers.
