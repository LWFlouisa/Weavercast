title: Esiomo -- What Is Hafestran Dii Musette?
published: true

Hafestran Dii Musette is a form of Esiomo revolving around the lives of Lusophone, Francophone, and Japanese musicians during the apocalyptic age after the Franco-Japanese wars. In general, these "lyrical comics" have more of a traditional and folk music sound, rather than modern pop. The characters are generally Lute, Accordion, Koto, and Shamisen players. It can be compared to a form of epic poetry, but in graphic form. The eventual aim of these is to cross over with the plotlines of Egierune and Fasehasi, however these stories are distinct for mostly revolving around the life stories of music artists, rather than specifically their romantic relationships.

The idea for this came when I wanted to experiment with Comics Poetry, which is a more lyrical form of the comics form. Although in Comics Poetry, there is a lot more that goes into it, and doesn't necessarily require a specific kind of narrative.

Hafestran Music, can be thought of as cultural blending of European and Asian traditions, specifically that of the Mediterranean and East and South Asia. Ionian, Dorian, Flamenco, Yo Scale, and In scale are commonly used musical scales. These songs are general a fusion of Olde French and Japanese ghost stories. There are also illusions to certain stories, like Santa Barbara do the influence of Catholicism on American Shinto.
