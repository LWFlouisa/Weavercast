title: If US Comics Should Learn Anything From Manga

If American Comics should learn anything from Manga, it should be the tendency for manga to split target audiences into male / female, and between: adults, teenagers, and children. I would further create catagories based on whether it's a male child or female child.

Manga also has issues of not hiring people who aren't native Japanese, until extremely recently when Viz Media, and then FINALLY Shounen Jump starting do things like Manga-Originals "inspired by manga". The Manga industry, in some ways, is actually the logical extension of what would happen in Comicsgate actually got what they wanted, and I don't mean that as a complement.

The Left-Wing aspects of American comics is actually a positive aspect to myself, although I do think Marvel and DC don't really understand left-wing values and concerns. For one thing, this radical "gender is a social construct and non-binary" spectrum is only a thing only the smallest minority of the left feel, and this doesn't genuinely reflect Transsexual goals: we actually would prefer to blend in.
