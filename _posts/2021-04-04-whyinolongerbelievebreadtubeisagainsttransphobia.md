title: Why I No Longer Believe Breadtube As Anti Transphobia As We're Led To Believe
published: true

It continues to baffle me how much transphobia is actually permitted, and how transwomen and transmen aren't even allowed to question how they are being represented by Breadtube. And yet, if you were take Breadtube at their word, one might be led to believe they were the least transphobic people around. That may be true in mainstream politics.

I was struck by a video where Kyle Kulinski said that Ben Shapiro and Dave Rubin frequently aren't as right-wing as they claim to be on camera. While don't they say the same thing about certain left-wingers on Youtube?

Here is a Secular Talk to give an idea of what I mean:

There is also the fact that on Twitter, despite this one guy ( not Kyle Kulinski ) being a breadtuber, for some reason he found it socially acceptable to say to a transwoman that she was being transphobic. One can't help but wonder if recent transitions by prominent youtubers were done at least in part in account of the fact that Breadtube took Philosophy Tube's video out of context.

One must ask then, who exactly was calling what she said transphobic? There is other little hints, and the fact that Breadtube finds using the Transsexual equivalent to Blackface acceptable, that perhaps Breadtube is not actually as non transphobic as one might be led to believe.

This is why it's important to ask trans women and trans men how they want to be represented. I'm a trans woman, but I'm not necessarily interested in eliminating gender roles. I also have views like: I consider Birkenstocks to be women's shoes. You can call me wrong for having that opinion, but you cannot call me transphobic for having this opinion. It's simply a different opinion about fashion. It reminds me of how my ex room mate would redefine Racism so that I was somehow racist for hating French people. Even though most French are as white as Americans.

And that's the problem, ideas about Systemic Racism and Systemic Transphobia serve really to mask the underlying issue that they still permit individual bad actors to be blatantly transphobic, by saying trans women are transphobic for opinions they don't agree with.
