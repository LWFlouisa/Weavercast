This episode is about creators on website whose sole purpose seems to be to punch down on creators, without the intention of really building other people up. To me this is the real issue, and less about Comicsgate specifically: especially as more and more dude bros abandon the hashtag. But the problem isn't so much the hashtag itself, as the behaviour pattern that mainstream comics also posesses. This is because this existed prior to the current division between ultra-left wing and ultra-right wing spaces. That's why addressing the behaviours in important, and not the idealogy.
