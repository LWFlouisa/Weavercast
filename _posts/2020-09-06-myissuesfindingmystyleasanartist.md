I mostly grew up watching Japanese animation, particularly the ones that got featured on Adult Swim. I could never relate to the standard American fare, even those that debateably featured more adult fare. This created a weird issue where I ( until recently ) wanted to mainly draw realistically, mostly because I didn't want to lower myself to producing the kind of garbage content Cartoon network featured. More on this stream.
