<i>As a side trivia, Esiabias ( or esiabus for men ), these are wooden shoes with the upper of a French Sabot, or a German Holzshuhe. But the pronged feet of a Japanese geta. A fictional footware of my fantasy culture.</i>

HER ESIABAS IN THE MIDNIGHT SHOWER

In a withered dress with
her esiabas, she waltzes
in the midnight garden light.
With her straw hat she waltzes in all the midnight hours.
Under the midnight hours, midnight sky sprinkles and showers.
To think that in all these hours she waltzes in showers.

In this tired waltz
she spirals downward into
the Winter snowfall.
She forgot to break her
fall, waltzing in the showers.

In a withered dress with
her esiabas, she waltzes
in the midnight garden light.
With her straw hat she waltzes in all the midnight hours.
Under the midnight hours, midnight sky sprinkles and showers.
To think that in all these hours she waltzes in showers.

Many years have been, since there was
a midnight shower that wasn't snow.
