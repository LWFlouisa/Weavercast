<i>As a side trivia, Esiabias ( or esiabus for men ), these are wooden shoes with the upper of a French Sabot, or a German Holzshuhe. But the pronged feet of a Japanese geta. A fictional footware of my fantasy culture.</i>

HER ESIABAS IN THE MIDNIGHT SHOWER

In a withered dress with<br />
her esiabas, she waltzes<br />
in the midnight garden light.<br />
With her straw hat she waltzes in all the midnight hours.<br />
Under the midnight hours, midnight sky sprinkles and showers.<br />
To think that in all these hours she waltzes in showers.

In this tired waltz<br />
she spirals downward into<br />
the Winter snowfall.<br />
She forgot to break her<br />
fall, waltzing in the showers.

In a withered dress with<br />

Under the midnight hours, midnight sky sprinkles and showers.<br />
To think that in all these hours she waltzes in showers.

Many years have been, since there was<br />
a midnight shower that wasn't snow.
