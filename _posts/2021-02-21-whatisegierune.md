title: Esioma -- What Is Fasehasi
published: true
---
Fasehasi is the “Hafestran” word for fashion. This revolves around the life stories of models who have one French parents, and one Japanese parent. This primarily means one French parent from France, but can also mean one parent from Haiti, and one from Quebec. In the Haitian variety, it can be thought of as child from a Brazilian and Haitian parent. But the most common variation is someone with one ( European ) French parent, and one Japanese ( Japan ) parent.

These models are descended from the earliest couples that survived the Franco-Japanese civil wars that split the US into French-speaking and Japanese-speaking regions. In a sense, it is a post rebuilding of the previous fashion industry with a focus on fashion for LGBT models. Their lives revolve around the various cruelties that exist in the industry to try to be thinner and look better, and the different forms of toxic masculinity placed on them. This approach to LGBT story telling also focuses on the reality of our lives, not what academic professors preach to us about us.

Sense the implication are frequently morbid, and often tragic, these are reserved exclusively for the older demographic of Esioma. Because of this, I will be rolling out age ratings for different books, to account for those who begin reading these in late high school, and those who read them in their college years. However these are never as dark as Gothique Dii Esiomo.
