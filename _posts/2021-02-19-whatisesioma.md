title: What Is Esioma: How It Is Different From Shojo And Josie Manga
published: true

Esiomi primarily focuses on on Esioma content, and because of this, has the greatest amount of variety of any categories in Esiomi. In fact, I primarily created this subset as an answer to Shounen Manga having such a glut of the market in comics, but wanted to focus on Shojo Manga that wasnâ€™t exclusively about relationships.

This primarily target those between the ages of 18-25, however it can edge into older demographics. There is also considerable bleed over between the Shojo demographic and the Josie demographic.

There are two main varieties of Esioma: Fasehasi, Ewasi Esiomo, and Esioma Dii Gothique. Fasehasi is primarily focused on the world of fashion in the post apocalyptic world that I have set up: in general, in contract to Manga, Esioma primarily targets the LGBT section of the reading community, which is reflected in the different fashion styles. These fashion books, for the time being, will also be based around my shoe fetishes as well.

Ewasi Esiomo, can be thought of as inspirational comics, that inspire lifestyle choices among this demographic. In this sense, this can include anything from tips on healthy eating, to finding interesting tourist locations in France and Japan. With a special love devoted to places where a Japanese chef has visited in France, or vice versa.

Esioma Dii Gothique, can be thought of as gothic romances. Contrary to what you might think, this is where most of the beheadings by guillotine happen, and not in Esiomu. However it is also sometimes present in those as well. Much of the romance is based around failed lesbian relationships. There is also a fair amount of what they Ero Guro.

This should give an early introduction to this target audience. This target demographic is a work in progress.
