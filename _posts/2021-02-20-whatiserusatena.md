title: What Is Erusatena -- A Uniquely American Form Of Alternative Comix
published: true

Erusatena can be thought of as educational comics that focus primarily on teaching the specific of the French language in the form of engaging stories, in order to make the process of learning languages more smooth. While the focus is on currently marketing to adult, eventually it may be expanded to include younger readers.

The inspiration for Erusatena came from Reluctant Reader books for Young Adults who have had a more difficult time learning English than the rest of their demographic. This can include Special Education teenagers, but also those who have just moved to a French speaking portion of America. Eventually this will be expanded to include the constructed language, that is a fusion of common Japanese words, and vocabulary and grammar in French.

Eventually Hafestran grammar may also follow the Japanese grammar pattern, along with French gender rules, although I havenâ€™t entirely decided if this will be the case. I will also eventually include example comics as I develop the script over time.
