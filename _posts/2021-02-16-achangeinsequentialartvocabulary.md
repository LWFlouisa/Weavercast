This episode is about my intention to switch from the word "Comic", to the word "Purse Drama". The idea behind the concept is that these are little "mangas" designed to fit inside of your purse. This would generally be pamphlets of 16 pages, that would be similar to Chick Tracks, except slightly bigger and generally reading in "top to down", and "right to left" in reading order.

These are specifically aimed at female readers, ranging from the ages 16-30, that revolve specifically around the "Tomboy" demographic--granola jeans and birkenstock wearing steampunk goggle dust dirtied princesses. This will be a cross over between "Shojo" and "Josie", but designed specifically for the Japanese Francophone community in the United States, and also French husbands of Japanese wives.
