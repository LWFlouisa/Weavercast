title: Double Standards In Moderation At Absolute Write
published: true

This blog post will be about an uncomfortable topic, in regards to my experience on Absolute Writer’s Water Cooler. Most of the time when you went to that message board, usually people would get banned from there simply for advocating for self-publishing. I’m one of those that tends to advocate for Hybrid Publishing myself: I self-publish some books, and traditionally publish other stuff. Although I would not self-publish anything on Smashwords or Amazon. However there is another more glaring issue that standards in stark contrast their obvious left-wing slant:

Back when I was a teenager, I submitted a story called “Herman Of Ducktown”--I still plan on rewriting the story as a graphic novel at some point, although I might not call the main character Herman. However, even though I intended the MC to be a white male MC, for some reason Mac Stone thought it was appropriate to libel my good reputation on there, by saying I was being racist for calling him “Dog Boy”.

This was despite the fact that the intent was that the boy was raised by and lives with wolves, that’s as close to a literal definition of the term dog boy as you’re going to get. I ultimately chose not to say anything, but the fact that she herself immediately assumed I was depicting a black character, is what is specifically so problematic. And yet she was the one calling me a racist. But lets put that aside for a minute, and assume benefit of the doubt: that she was really concerned about the racism. She didn’t even ask if I intended my main characters as caucasian, which until extremely recently when all my MC can be assumed as being “half Japanese, and half French”, was pretty much always the case.

There is also the fact that, she herself basically permitted and kept on the website an image of the Nazi Swastica, yet has banned people from the website for much less bad offenses, like defending self-publishing: how exactly this is problematic should be clear to anyone with a brain. Sure it is a mistake that I did not clarify that Herman was a white boy raised by wolves, by how is that somehow worse than permitting an actual hate symbol on your website?

While it is true that all writers should have a thicker skin, and accept constructive critique, there is a fine line between suggesting things to change in a story, and literally dehumanizing other people, for those that you yourself are as more guilty of. We on the radical left critique hate groups like Comicsgate for this thing they do against people like myself ( a trans woman ), and yet somehow permit that same kind of dehumanization on old and obscure writing forums.

We need to remember, if we seek to check others privilege, lets also remember to check our own privilege as well.
