title: Episode 6. What Is Epirune Dii Esiomi -- An Hafestran Light Novel Form
published: true
---
There are four sets of "Light Novels" for the Hafestran language:

Epiruse Dii Esiomu - These light novels are generally targeted at older teenagers and young men. The plots generally revolving around the "main action" in Post Apocalyptic narratives, rather than relationships that happen behind the scenes. In general, I plan on focusing less on Esiomu type narratives.

Epiruse Dii Esioma - These light novels are generally targeted at older teenagers to young women, and revolve around the romantic relationships in apocalyptic scenarios. My approach with Esiomi will primarily focus on these sorts of plot lines, with occassional dips into Epiruse Dii Esiomu.

Epiruse Dii Esiomo - These are two cross gender Post Apocalyptic books, that focus on every aspect of the Post Apocalyptic world of French and Japanese speaking portions of the United States. I consider my first Light Novel to be Epiruse Dii Esiomo. Within its own continuity, Epiruse Dii Esiomo can lean toward Esiomu or Esioma.

Eventually I will be switching to using these catagories when marketing my work, making the system I use distinct from the catagories used in Manga Magazines, along with using a picto-syllabic language that is left to right, even though these will still be drawn right to left in graphic novel form.
