The concept was created partially out of a dare between me and a room mate I had three years ago.

And not only that, that I could make them speak about profound issues about the practice of capital punishment. This episode goes into more specifics.

### Example Story
In these stories, the guillotine is the default means of capital punishment. Although this will be phased out for using the National Razor Crossbow, a portable form of the public decapitation machine. Consider these as prototypes.
